<h1 style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 24px">Autumn Academy 2022</h1>

We proudly present the first edition of the next regular online event in the annual calender of MIDL: The Autumn Academy! Feel warmly welcomed to grab a cup of tea, curl up in a cozy blanket in front of your device and join a tutorial to train your research skills.
And for this first edition, we chose one of the most important and similarly one of the most under-represented research skills to train: Reproducibility!

The Autumn Academy will take place on **30. November 2022** and will start at **15:00 CET**. The tutorial will be held virtually via Zoom, and of course, there will be a Get-Together afterwards in our well-established MIDL event center in Gather.Town. Participation will be **free of charge**!

## Tutorial: How to make your research reproducible? ![Portrait of Attila Simko](/images/autumn-academy/attilasimko.jpg){: class="align-right" width="180" }

Concerns about the reproducibility of deep learning research are more prominent than ever, with no clear solution in sight. Providing public source code is a powerful solution for one aspect of reproducibility, however the quality of these repositories vary widely between projects and might cause more harm than good. Evaluating all full paper submissions at MIDL shows that public repositories are becoming increasingly popular, however some tiny design flaws hinder their repeatability and usefulness over time. Based on these results and some commonly encountered problems, MIDL proposed a reproducibility guideline to help authors design a repository for their submission. (Following the guidelines is completely optional and their aim is not to regulate authors, but to help them.) During the tutorial we will discuss source code repositories and the proposed guideline, and through a series of discussion points we will have the chance to make changes to the guideline helping ourselves and future authors. No coding skills are required for the tutorial.

The tutorial will be led by [Attila Simko](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/attila-simko/) from Umea University.

## Background: Reproducibility in MIDL

From its very beginnings in 2018, MIDL has always been commited to open science and transparency. The repsoducibility of research, especially the reproducibility of code, models and implemented experiments, is a crucial part of that mission. However, there are typically few (or only very hidden) incentives to take that extra effort on your paper, and until now, MIDL has not been a big excemption in that regard. Recently, a highly motivated team from Umea University in Sweden provided evidence that [only 22% of all MIDL papers are really reproducible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11146). Luckily, they already proposed possible guidelines on reproducibility of MIDL papers, and we are now making these an integral part of our strategy and give our best to spread the word in the community. We firmly believe that the majority of not reproducible papers is not due to an active decision but to a lack of awareness. And what is the solution for that? An Autumn Academy solely dedicated to Reproducibility, open to the whole community!

Fact is: Reproducibility will become more and more important in the next years and will become a part of the review process in future MIDL editions. But besides that, your paper will benefit a lot since more people can use your methods more easily and thus your work will have a much higher impact.
So, there are enough incentives to already join the movement today. And the easiest step is to join our Autumn Academy!
